## Structure of the site

The site has two primary folders where notes are stored:
- Library: notes taken **from** books
- Ideas: notes written **about** books, or rather, notes written about the ideas, themes, and messages within books.

## Library Notes
Most of my book notes are structured as follows:
- Favourite quotes
- Summary
- Main idea(s) and/or Analysis
- Reflections (sometimes)

For many of my book notes, the analysis section is either non-existent or very empty. That's because I save most of my analysis for an idea note.

The summary section varies from book to book. Some books are summarized in significant detail, while others are very surface level. Some contain direct quotes, others just paraphrased passages. 

My summary section may also contain sub-headings within chapters that are not from the author but rather my own creation. When this happens, I usually call it out at the beginning of the summary section.


## Idea Notes
An idea note is simply a note on a very specific topic taken from one or more book notes. A good book will often end up generating or contributing to several idea notes.

In other words, an idea note can contain quotes, ideas, and analyses from one or more book notes, and a book note can contribute to zero or more idea notes (yes, some books may not contribute to even a single idea note).

The rules that I've implemented for my idea notes are as follows:
1. they should be fairly small in length, ideally less than 500 words
	- I do have some notes that are much longer, some of which are purposeful while others I do intend on breaking up into smaller notes in the future
2. they should be readable on their own, meaning understanding or knowing about the source or reference (the book) should not be a pre-requisite to understanding the idea note.
	- some of my idea notes don't follow this rule and that is purely due to my own laziness and something I intend to fix eventually
