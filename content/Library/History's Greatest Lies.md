# Summary
## Chapter 15: The Unconquerable Afghanistan?
- this chapter explains why it's a false notion that Afghanistan is impossible to conquer
- the reality of the situation is that Afghanistan is easy to conquer, but unifying or controlling it is near impossible
- [[Why Afghanistan Is Hard To Control]]
- seems that the ancient name of Herat was 'Areia' or 'Arya'
- Alexander the Great easily conquered, but after a few short years he left cause he couldn't control it - page 256
	- this was shocking for Alexander as he has never given up before
- the leader to first create some sort of centralized power in Afghanistan was Amir Abdur Rahman Khan who took the throne in 1880
	- he was allied with the British who handled his foreign affairs while he focused internally
- During the Anglo-Afghan wars starting in 1838, the British easily took over but very quickly had to retreat due to not being being to control the country.
- the same story was repeated with the Soviet Union. 100k troops deployed, 14k dead Russian soldiers. They had to retreat after 10 years.
- Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security advisor Jimmy Carter, claimed that he started funding the mujahedeen 6 months prior to the invasion by the Soviets, and that this was all a plan to instigate an invasion from the Soviet Union. Their end-goal was to create a 'Vietnam' for the Soviets, i.e. a long drawn-out battle that would drain them. And it worked. Just 2-3 years after the withdrawal from Afghanistan the Soviet Union collapsed.

# Reflections
This chapter was short yet very informative. It really decimates the myth that 'Afghanistan is impossible to conquer'. In reality, it's not, but it's very hard to control.
