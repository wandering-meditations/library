# Analysis 
## Notes & Quotes
### Sacrifice
- Mariam sacrificed herself to save Laila and the kids. She is content in her execution because she is glad that she got to experience true love and happiness during the years of living with Laila, especially since before that she was living a depressed life.
- Mariam's father didn't sacrifice for her: he chose to neglect her because she was illegitimate, he didn't want to tarnish her reputation
- Although Mariam's father did not sacrifice for her, that didn't stop Mariam from sacrificing her life to save Laila

### Mariam's Character Arc
- she was a poor illegitimate child. She was neglected
- she was forced to get married and is angry, bitter, and resentful
- she gets constantly abused by her husband Rasheed
- when Rasheed decides to marry a second, Laila, Mariam ends up hating her
- Eventually Mariam and Laila do become close friends
- Mariam makes the ultimate sacrifice: her life in exchange of saving Laila and her kids

## Main Idea of the Book
- I think the author was trying to explain the tough life of Afghan living in those times under Taliban rule.
- I think his main message or theme is that of sacrifice (see sacrifice section above)
