## Terminology
- Bactria: a land known today as Balkh (province in modern Afghanistan). Historically it was a very important land for many different empires due to its strategic location and developed culture.
- Bactrian: an extinct Persian language spoken by the people of Bactria. It went extinct around the 8th century AD when Farsi became the official language when the Muslims took over. Today, the closest languages to Bactrian are the Pamir languages and Pashto
- Achaemenid: a powerful Persian Empire started by Cyrus the Great. Some of Persia's most popular kings, like Darius the Great and Xerxes, come from this empire.

## IVC: 3500BC - 1750BC
- The Indus Valley Civilization included modern day India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan
- an example of a city at this time was Mundigak, near modern Kandahar
- The slow collapse of the IVC coincides with the migration of the Aryans into the region

## Achaemenid: 500BC - 330BC
- Bactria was one of the most prominent cities in the Achaemenid empire
- Zoroastrianism was the main religion of the Afghans

## Alexander the Great: 330 - 323BC
![[Pasted image 20241009205908.png|150]]
- Controlling Afghanistan was too difficult for Alexander (image above) so he had to leave
- on his way out, he died somewhere around Babylon
- Alexander left a lasting impact despite only ruling for a few years
	- Kandahar is named after him
	- his generals started empires and mini-states after him in the general region
	- possibly a genetic impact, not just him directly but his Greek army as well
		- fun fact: Alexander married 3 woman during his life:
			- his first wife was an Afghan Bactrian princess named Roxana/Rukhshana (Old Iranian meaning 'shining/radiant'). Their child together became the next King of Macedonia, King of Egypt, and Pharaoh of Egypt.
			- several years later he wed two more women in a joint ceremony: Stateira and Parysatis. Both were Persian princesses who were daughters of two different Persian kings (Darius and Artaxerces respectively)

## Seleucid Empire: 312 - 300BC
![[Pasted image 20241009205818.png|100]]
- founded by a general of Alexander, Seleucus Nicator (image above)
- 300BC is when they signed a treaty with the Maurya and gave them the south and east, namely Kabul and Kandahar
- The Seleucids continued to rule Bactria and the west for a while longer

## Maurya Empire: 300 - 185BC
![[Pasted image 20241009211044.png|200]] 
- an Indian Empire based out of Patna in the east of modern India
- they brought Buddhism to Afghanistan under Asoka (image above), the third ruler and grandson of the founder of the Maurya
- they only ever controlled areas around Kabul and Kandahar
	- they never had the west (Herat) or the north (Bactria)

## Greco-Bactrian Kingdom: 256BC - 120BC
- after the Seleucids lost most their power (due to invasions from the Parthians), the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was established in Bactria
- the kingdom was founded by Diodotus, a governor for the Seleucids in Bactria

## Various small city state kingdoms: ~200 - 30AD
- various kingdoms include Greco-Bactrians (see above), Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian, Indo-Parthians
- The Indo-Greek were the successors of the Greco-Bactrian. They collapsed in 10AD, defeated by the Scythians who came from the Steppe
- Indo-Parthians were the last to control most of Afghanistan before the Kushans arrived

## Parthian Empire: 250BC - 220AD
![[Pasted image 20241009211332.png|200]]
- they were a central Asian Iranian group
- they rivalled the Roman empire in power, and actually defeated them in Asia Minor
- they reached the height of their power in 90BC under Mithridates II (image above)

## Kushan Empire: 30 - 375AD
![[Pasted image 20241009212701.png|200]]
- they took most of Afghanistan from the Parthians around 60AD
- the largest extent was under Kanishka the Great in ~130AD (image above)
- Kanishka brought a revival of Buddhism to Afghanistan
- He was an ethnic Yuezhi, an Indo-European people and spoke Tocharian natively, although the language of his empire was Bactrian
	- it was Greek before him, but he switched the administrative language to Bactrian
- The Kushans participated in the Sulk Road, establishing trade with China and Rome which made them rich
- Kanishka's central capital was Peshawar; his summer capital was Bagram on the foundations of Kapish-Kanish and Alexandria-in-the-Caucasus; his winter capital was Mathura in India
- the Kushan empire didn't last long, but was one of the greatest in Afghanistan, mainly due to the fact it connected all the great civilizations together - Persians, Indians, Romans, and Greeks
- their collapse started around 225AD when Scythians came down in large numbers

## Sassanid: 224 - 651AD
- founded by Ardashir, grandson of Sassan, who revolted against the weak Parthians
- they conquered Afghanistan from the declining Kushans
- they were the last empire to rule before the advent of Islam
- per [[Afghanistan - Graveyard of Empires]], the name 'Afghan' was first recorded during this time. 
	- The term 'Afghan' was written as 'Abgan', which can be pronounced 'Avghan' when you spell it in Greek (which is what Bactrian used as a script in those times). The term was simply used to describe a people living in the area at that time. 
	- the likeliest origin of the term 'Afghan' is that it derives from the Sanskrit word 'Asvakan' which means "horsemen"

## Various Iranian Huns
- White Huns (Hephthalites), Nezak Huns, Alchon Huns
- mostly Buddhist. They spoke Bactrian
- Islam existed at this time, but Afghans were not Muslim yet
	- it took at least 200 years for Afghans to become Muslim
- the ethnicity of White Huns is largely a mystery
	- they were probably a client people of the Avars
	- Roman historian Procopius said that they are part of the Huns, but they are the only Hun group to have white bodies and "countenances which are not ugly"
	- it's possible they were a branch of the Scythians
	- likely they were a mixture of Indo-Aryan and Turkic
- The White Huns defeated the Sassanids and took Merv and Herat.
- By the 5th century AD, the Sassanids regained control over their former territories, leading to a collapse of the White Huns

## Post Islam
- usually some Iranian empire controlled the west and a north Indian (often Turkic in origin) empire controlled the east
	- examples would be the Kabul Shahi dynasty, the Ghaznavids, and the Qarakhanid dynasty
- in the 7th century AD, it was the Rashidun
- in the 8th century AD, the Turkic Sammanids defeated the weak Abbasids and gained most of Afghan land
- in the late 10th century AD, the Ghaznavids, a Turkic group based in Ghazni defeated the Sammanids and gained control over Afghanistan
	- they controlled as far west as Sistan and as far east as Lahore
- in the 12th century Ad, the Ghorid dynasty who came from the mountains of Ghor (Central Afghanistan), defeated the Ghaznavids
	- The Ghorids expanded the empire to Delhi
- in 1205 the Ghorid collapsed and were absorbed into the Khwarazm Empire (Persianized Turkic)
- then the Mongols came
