# Description
## Afghanistan's Place in the World
- Is it part of the Middle East, Central Asia, or Southeast Asia (Indian subcontinent)? 
	- The best answer is none. Rather it's part of "Turko-Persia", both geographically and culturally
- **Turko-Persia** = the geographical landscape is as follows:
	- begins at the western tip of the Zagros mountain (border of Iran and Turkey) in the west
	- the Pashtun lands to the east, 
	- stretches north to the Caucasus in the north-west
	- the Eurasian steppe at the Syr Darya in the north-east (includes modern Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and the southern parts of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan)
- Today Turko-Persia is considered: Iran, Afghanistan, Pakhtunkhwa, Baluchistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan
- One MAY include India to a certain extent, due to the influence the Moghul Empire had in the region, the Moghuls being a Turko-Persian empire
### Why does this categorization make sense?
- historically this region has been under the control of the various Persian Empires, and these empires were ruled by Persians at some times, and Turks during other times
	- because of this, these areas today, and the people living there, share aspects of traditions, culture, etc
- they all speak a Turkic and/or Persian language, many times they are bilingual
- the simplest distinction / thing that makes this area unique is the celebration of Nowruz, a tradition going way back before Islam. All the countries in Turko-Persia have Nowruz as an **official** holiday
	- the Islamic Revolution in Iran nor the Taliban could ban Nowruz, despite wanting to due to religious reasons
- The Turkic and Persian people have historically been very close to one another, in all aspects, there's even a proverb about it: *a hat without a head is like a Turk without a Tajik (Persian)*
