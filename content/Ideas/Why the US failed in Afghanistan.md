# Reasons that the US Failed in Afghanistan
1. The US miscalculated the nature of Afghan warfare[^2]
	- When the US ousted the Taliban, they thought they won the war
	- the countryside and tribal warriors was completely ignored or forgotten by the Americans. Those were the real people that they'd have to face. You can't just focus on the 'central government' that holds no real power anyways
	- the reliance on air power was wrong; air power does not hold/control ground, soldiers do. The Americans did not understand this
2. Post 9/11 the American goals in Afghanistan became unclear[^2]
	- they wanted to nation build, but weren't fully committed... Bush had plans to invade Iraq so the planning and money went towards that
	- they also wanted to wipe out Al Qaeda and the Taliban; neither goal was met
	- what's worse is that US officials KNEW they had no strategy and their objectives were muddled. They weren't even sure the objectives they did define were attainable[^1]
3. America's faulty assessment of Pakistan
	-  the creation of this border by Durand created a new invisible country on the map: **Pashtunistan**[^2]
	- The US trusted that Pakistan would secure the border to prevent Taliban or Al Qaeda operatives getting through either side... what the US didn't know is in reality, **there is no border**, people come and go as they please[^2]
	- The Taliban had a safe haven in Pakistan. Furthermore, Pakistan assisted them in many ways[^1]
	- the US did not take any action against Pakistan. If they had, things would've turned out much different[^1]
4. Misunderstanding of the Taliban[^2]
	- the Taliban was simply a charismatic movement that saw a problem (corruption by warlords) that people needed a solution for. The Taliban was that solution
	- the Taliban was drew in various people from tribes all over. When the Taliban fell, those people simply returned to their home tribes
5. The Iraq War[^2]
	- all the money, resources, and best military divisions were being deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan was being ignored. This allowed instability to remain unchecked
6. nation-building on a US template[^1]
	- centralized government. Afghanistan is a type of country where a centralized government simply cannot exist
7. not bothering to understand Afghan society, customs, culture, etc[^1]
	- the US did everything their own way, when they should've been doing the Afghan way, or at least a mix of both
	- hand-washing project... what a joke - p. 168 [[The Afghanistan Papers - A Secret History of the War]]
