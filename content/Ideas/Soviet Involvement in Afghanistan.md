# Reasons for the Soviets Entering Afghanistan Militarily (1979)
- deterioration of communist power
	- the leaders of the Afghan communist party were implemented strict social changes too quickly which led them to gain LOTS of enemies. This led to various tribes rising up and taking control over their own provinces
	- they used the Brezhnev Doctrine, which states that the Soviet Union MUST militarily intervene in any country where communist rule is under threat
	- they suspected that if the Amin regime were to collapse, that would be the end of Communist rule and the start of Islamist rule
- the leader pre-invasion was Amin, who the Soviets suspected was working with the US, and had friendly ties to China and Pakistan who the Soviets opposed
	- they wanted to install their loyalist, Babrak Karmal
- the Soviets thought it'd be easy work!
	- they hoped to complete their objectives in 6 months... it ended up being almost a decade
	- this war is called "Russian's Vietnam" because it is what ultimately caused the Soviet Union to collapse
- the Soviets believed the CIA was empowering Islamist groups, which would threaten Soviet territory in Central Asia
