# Reasons for Afghanistan Being Hard to Control
- so what reasons contributed to Afghanistan being hard to control after conquest?[^1]
	- so many diverse ethnic groups who have their own unique languages and cultures. Therefore **they live by their own rule**. As a result, **Afghanistan has never been a unified nation**
		- Austro-Hungary also had this exact same problem. It simply never works[^3]
	- the people are 'Afghan' in name only. There's not sense of unity among them.
	- The borders mean nothing to the Afghan people. It was created during the reign of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan by the British, Russians, and Indians
	- The Durand line cuts the Pashtun homeland right in half. Many Pashtuns still do not recognize it. It's practically a lawless land with each village operating independently.
	- The terrain is problematic for conquest, and therefore for control. The valleys are impassable most of the year due to snow, there are vast deserts separating fertile zones, and 2/3 of the land is 5000+ feet above sea level (high altitude)
	- Due to the terrain, **Afghan people have always lived in isolation from each other** resulting in a different way of life. For example, the Nuristiani's, only until 100 years ago, worshipped a pantheon of nature gods similar to ancient Greek paganism.
	- at a very fundamental level, **Afghanistan's terrain facilitates divisions of power and resists the concept of centralized control**
	- even after conquest, you'll never truly defeat them. Afghans are skilled in guerilla warfare and will fight until the invader's army and morale is at a low to the point where politicians will want to retreat.
		- this is the story of the Afghan people for the last 2500 years. Invasion by a foreigner, then many years of guerilla warfare until the invaders flee. Then simply waiting for the next foreigner to invade
			- Alexander invaded and it got to the point where his army was weakening and his soldiers were losing morale due to the constant fighting, so he had to retreat.
			- The first and second Anglo-Afghan wars portray this perfectly. The Afghans just kept coming and coming at the British until the British couldn't sustain themselves any longer.
	- Afghans are masters at fighting in the valleys, hills, and mountains, which is the majority of their country. Opposing armies had very little success against them
		- meanwhile in Kandahar, Afghans always had trouble defeating larger or more technologically advanced enemies because Kandahar is a flat plain
	- Afghanistan has always been a target due to it's place on the map. It's called the 'crossroads of empires' being situation right between 3 major regions: Central Asia, Middle East, and India/South East Asia. So it was a prized target for any major empire back in the day

## Why Various States Kept Failing
- the problem is this: using state power to change Afghan society without the cooperation of its people[^2]
- this is the reason why all governments in the 20th century collapsed: Amanullah in 1929, Daoud in 1978, communists in 1992, and the Taliban in 2001
	- Amanullah wanted to modernize & secularize the country and introduced cultural reforms like rights for women, laws against polygamy, laws against child marriage, abolishing hijab, moving Jumu'ah to Thursday, etc
	- Daoud was continuing the modernizing efforts and was mainly anti-Islamic in a country full of Muslims
	- the Communists were basically like Amanullah, but on crack
	- the Taliban
- Abdur Rahman was successful because he never tried to change Afghan society, his only focus was on taxation and security, and of course staying in power
