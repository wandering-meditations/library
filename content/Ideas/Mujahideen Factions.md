There were 7 recognized and prominent Mujahideen factions during the Soviet-Afghan war (1979-1989).

## Strict
These 4 were more staunchly Islamic and wanted an Islamic government (anti-west, anti-monarchy, anti-democracy).
### Burhanudeen Rabbani (d. 2011)
- the leader:
	- pre-war, he founded an Afghan "Ikhwan al-Muslimin" group
	- he translated books of Sayed Qutb into Farsi
	- he was assassinated in 2011. The Taliban claimed responsibility.
- the group
	- this group had the strongest military and the most diverse, composed of ethnic Tajiks, Pashtuns and Turks (Uzbeks, Turkmens, etc)
	- they operated all over the country but main military operations were in the north and west
	- Prominent commanders: Ahmad Shah Masoud of Panjshir, Ismail Khan of Herat
	- Ahmad Shah Masoud led an attack against Daoud's government in 1975 in the Panjshir
		- this means his faction was the only one militarily active BEFORE the Soviet invasion
	- Ahmad Shah ruled the Panjshir Valley, probably the most targeted place after the major cities due to its strategic location. He was very successful in defending it against the Soviets
		- it was also the ONLY province to withstand all Taliban assaults in the 90s

### Gulbudeen Hekmatyar (still alive)
- the leader:
	- he was an ethnic Pashtun of the Kharoti sub-tribe of the Ghilzai. Born in Kunduz, away from his tribal homeland of Paktika
	- was an engineering student at Kabul University and was close friends with Ahmad Shah Masoud and Burhanudeen Rabbani. He was part of the same Islamic club
	- when the war started, he left the group and started his own
- the group
	- his group was just behind Rabbani's in terms of strength and military activity
	- composed along ethnic lines, mainly Pashtun

### Rasul Sayyaf (still alive)
- the leader:
	- he was an Islamic scholar, studied Islam at Kabul University and Al-Azhar
	- from Kabul, of the Ghilzai tribe
	- he was part of Rabbani's Ikhwani group pre-war 
	- once the war began, he led the charge to internalize the Jihad efforts, gaining support from Saudi Arabia and Arabs in general
- the group:
	- they operated mainly in the south and east of the country
	- received support from Saudi Arabia, largely because of Rasul's ties with the Saudi royal family and Wahhabi leanings
	- was close with Osama Bin Laden in the early days
	- after the war, the group continued to operate training camps to train people to fight in Jihad conflicts world wide (Chechnya, Bosnia, etc)
	- joined Rabbani's faction after the Soviets left
	- the group was against the Taliban, joining the Northern Alliance to take back Afghanistan

### Muhammad Yunis Khalis (d. 2006)
- the leader:
	- he was an Islamic scholar, studied  at Darul Uloom Haqqania
	- from Nangarhar, of the Khogyani tribe (Karlani)
	- pre-war, he wrote a book criticizing Daoud Khan. He was forced to flee to Pakistan in 1974
	- wrote books on Islam in Pashto and Farsi, including a translation of Sayyid Qutb's "Social Justice in Islam"
	- died in 2006 of natural causes
- the group:
	- initially part of Hekmatyar's group then split at the very start of the war
	- they operated mainly in the south and east of the country
	- Prominent commanders: "The 3 brothers" (Abdul Haq, Abdul Qadir, Din Muhammad), Amin Wardak, Jalaludeen Haqqani ("The Haqqani Network")
	- some Taliban were in this group
	- his group was based around tribal affiliations (fellow Karlani) rather than religious/ethnic lines
	- joined Rabbani's faction after the Soviets left
	- when the Taliban took over, this group supported them. Yunis himself moved to Pakistan
	- once US invaded, they returned to take back their stronghold of Nangarhar from Taliban control, i.e. they were never truly pro-Taliban

## Moderate
They wanted a constitutional government, were friendlier with the west, and didn't even mind a return of the monarchy if that meant a stable Afghanistan.
### Muhammad Nabi Muhammadi (d. 2002)
- the leader:
	- he was an Islamic scholar (studied mainly locally) and spiritual leader. Many Taliban learned under him.
	- from Logar province, likely an Ahmadzai (Ghilzai) Pashtun
	- pre-war, going back to 1958, he spoke out against communist influence creeping into Afghanistan
	- in 1965 he was elected to the Afghan parliament where he openly spoke out against communism
	- died in 2002 of Tuberculosis
- the group:
	- some Taliban were in this group, including Mullah Omar
	- nearly on the same level of strength as Hekmatyar, both of them just behind Rabbani's group
	- joined Rabbani's faction after the Soviets left
	- once the civil war began, he forbade his group from participating and he urged the other leaders to stop fighting
