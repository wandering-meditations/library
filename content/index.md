<br>

Hello, fellow wanderer. I see you've found my library. 

Well, don't be shy, feel free to take a look around. Nothing is off limits.

I can't promise you'll find what you're looking for, but I do hope I at least inspire something within you. Maybe my library can influence your next reading choice, or your next essay/novel idea, or your next adventure in life. 

At the start of any new venture, remember to enter with an open mind as you never know what may come of it. 
A quote from Vladimir Bartol comes to mind:
> "Study, get to know the world. Be afraid of nothing. Cast aside all your prejudices. Let nothing be too lofty or too base for you. Explore everything. Be brave." - [[Alamut]]

<br>

That said, without further adieu, welcome, dear friend, to my library.
